# EX-NO-13-MESSAGE-AUTHENTICATION-CODE-MAC

## AIM:
To implementÂ MESSAGE AUTHENTICATION CODE(MAC)

## ALGORITHM:

1. Message Authentication Code (MAC) is a cryptographic technique used to verify the integrity and authenticity of a message by using a secret key.

2. Initialization:
   - Choose a cryptographic hash function \( H \) (e.g., SHA-256) and a secret key \( K \).
   - The message \( M \) to be authenticated is input along with the secret key \( K \).

3. MAC Generation:
   - Compute the MAC by applying the hash function to the combination of the message \( M \) and the secret key \( K \): 
     \[
     \text{MAC}(M, K) = H(K || M)
     \]
     where \( || \) denotes concatenation of \( K \) and \( M \).

4. Verification:
   - The recipient, who knows the secret key \( K \), computes the MAC using the received message \( M \) and the same hash function.
   - The recipient compares the computed MAC with the received MAC. If they match, the message is authentic and unchanged.

5. Security: The security of the MAC relies on the secret key \( K \) and the strength of the hash function \( H \), ensuring that an attacker cannot forge a valid MAC without knowledge of the key.

## Program:
```
MAC_SIZE = 32
def compute_mac(key: str, message: str) -> bytes:
    key_bytes = key.encode()
    message_bytes = message.encode()
    mac = bytearray(MAC_SIZE)
    
    for i in range(MAC_SIZE):
        mac[i] = key_bytes[i % len(key_bytes)] ^ message_bytes[i % len(message_bytes)]
    
    return bytes(mac)

def main():
    key = input("Enter the secret key: ")
    message = input("Enter the message: ")
    mac = compute_mac(key, message)
    print("Computed MAC (in hex):", mac.hex())
    received_mac_hex = input("Enter the received MAC (as hex): ").strip()
    try:
        received_mac = bytes.fromhex(received_mac_hex)
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid hexadecimal input.")
        return
    if mac == received_mac:
        print("MAC verification successful. Message is authentic.")
    else:
        print("MAC verification failed. Message is not authentic.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```
